This is the repository for [the PopcornJS.org website](http://mozilla.github.io/popcornjs.org/), now hosted on GitHub Pages.

## PopcornJS

The PopcornJS library is its own repository: **[popcorn-js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)**

## Contributing

Since this website is hosted on GitHub using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), all of its content is in [the  `gh-pages` branch of this repository](https://github.com/mozilla/popcornjs.org/tree/gh-pages). The `gh-pages` branch is a special branch; when GitHub sees it has been updated, it automatically runs the branch through [Jekyll](http://tom.preston-werner.com/jekyll/) and creates a website out of it at **[http://mozilla.github.io/popcornjs.org](http://mozilla.github.io/popcornjs.org)**.
