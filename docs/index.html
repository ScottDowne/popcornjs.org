<p>For media makers: Popcorn.js allows video, audio and other media to control elements of a webpage. Combining our library with a mixture of standard HTML  JavaScript, authors can let their media be the "conductor" of interactive and immersive experiences. For developers: Popcorn.js is an event framework for HTML5 media. Popcorn.js utilizes the native HTMLMediaElement properties, methods and events, normalizes them into an easy to learn API, and provides a plugin system for community-contributed interactions.</p>
